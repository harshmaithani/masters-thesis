#  Usage from an external project:
#    In your CMakeLists.txt, add these lines:

#
#    This file will define the following variables:
#      - @ICLIB_PACKAGE_NAME_CONFIGCMAKE@_LIBRARIES            : The list of libraries to links against.
#      - @ICLIB_PACKAGE_NAME_CONFIGCMAKE@_LIB_DIR              : The directory where lib files are. Calling LINK_DIRECTORIES

#      - @ICLIB_PACKAGE_NAME_CONFIGCMAKE@_INCLUDE_DIRS         : The include directories.

#    Advanced variables:
