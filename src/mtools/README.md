# mTools 
Sylvain's catkin packages and robotics tools. 

## Robot modelling

## Trajectory
Implements trajectory generator for robots following Wisima Khalil's Modelling and Control of Robots book.
Implemented: 
  - joint space point-to-point, with quintic linear interpolation. 
  - joint space trajectory through via points, with linear interpolation and continuous acceleration blends
  - cartesian space trajectory through via points, with linear interpolation and continuous acceleration blends 
  
## Advanced control

## Data backup
Tools for backing up several representations of data, either vector or matrix. All are tracked along time.
This package is a header-only one, meaning there's no need of any library linking
